## Abstract

In this project, we implemented quantum simulator that simulates interacting
system that consists of 1D and 2D spin sites. We simulated for all the given
models, including XX, XXZ, and disordered XX models, and for all the given
initial states, represented by Neel and domain wall states. Also, we
simulated the interaction schemes for 1D next neighborhood model and 2D nearest
neighborhood model which were given as the advanced task. To validate the result, we
also developed classical algorithm to simulate the same system, which are capable
up to N=16 sites. Furthermore, we pointed out the inherent limitation of the
noisy quantum simulation, and implemented a VFF circuit, which uses
diagonalization, and is a potential solution to the problem.
